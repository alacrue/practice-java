programming problems from coding challenges/interviews - mostly inelegant

MiddleChar (interview problem)
\tfind the middle character of a string. If there are an even number of characters in the string, return middle two.
    e.g. "u" is output for the word "truck" and "os" is output for the word "rose"
  does not handle strings with spaces, does not have a way for user to quit (ctrl + c quits)
  there are certainly much better ways to do this, but w/o looking it up and giving myself 30 minutes to complete, this
  is what I came up with. (unsuccessfully worked through this problem during actual interview).
